# Telegram Bots

This is a repository for my Telegram Bots, written in Javascript and run using Node.

### Getting Started

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run the Javscript backend on your local machine.

### Installing

You can download or clone this repository to run the files. Do not only download the .js files, as there are .json files for storing information.

After downloading, use npm to install Telegraf `npm install telegraf`. You should be ready to run the the .js files in this repository. Run using `node file.js`.

## Deployment

To fully run this on your own telegram bot, follow the [Telegram Bot-Making Guide](https://core.telegram.org/bots) and use the given api key in place of `botkeys['BotName']` in the code.
